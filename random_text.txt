before to migrate a smart contract first we have to compile it using truffle 
>>truffle compile 
this will create a json representation  of the SC which will be stored in the builed directory of the contract
..The next step is of migration which is done by creating a .js file in the migration directory of the project
migration is actually changing the state of the blockchain 
>>truffle migrate:
this execute a funtion which is exported by the migration.js as module.export = function(deployer){
}
Migration is default contract which is used to keep track of status of other migrations 
msg.sender refer to the address of the account that called the funtion
we must interact with the block-chain in asynchronous fashion we cal also use  promises
